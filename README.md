**Unique Integers Assignment**
Task Description
The goal of this assignment is to read a list of integers from an input file, identify the unique integers, and generate an output file containing these unique integers in sorted order.

**Instructions**
Input File: The input file contains one integer per line (positive or negative). Variations in input lines (whitespace, invalid lines) should be handled as specified.
Output File: The output file should contain a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in increasing order.


**Handling Variations:**
Skip lines with no inputs or white spaces.
Skip lines with two integers separated by white space.
Skip lines containing non-integer input (e.g., alphabets, punctuation marks, floating point numbers).


**Approach**
Create a data structure (e.g., a set) to store unique integers.
Read each line from the input file.
Parse the line to extract the integer.
Add the integer to the set if itâ€™s valid (skip invalid lines).
After reading all lines, sort the unique integers.
Write the sorted integers to the output file.
**Usage**
Compile or run your code (e.g., UniqueInt.cpp).
Provide the input file path and output file path as arguments.
Verify that the output file contains the correct list of unique integers.
